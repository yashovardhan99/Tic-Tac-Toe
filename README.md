To play the game, make sure python is installed. Download the files [ticTacToe.py](ticTacToe.py) and [ticTacToeStart](ticTacToeStart.py). Then run [ticTacToeStart.py](ticTacToeStart.py) using any command line tool.
## Simulation
An alternative weaker AI has been created in [ticTacToeCenterFirstAI](ticTacToeCenterFirstAI.py). To test it, download [the original file](ticTacToe.py), [the alternative AI file](ticTacToeCenterFirstAI.py) and [the simulator script](ticTacToeSimulator.py) and then run ticTacToeSimulator.py. You can also make necessary changes in the simulator such as changing which AI goes first or the number of games to be played. Comments have been added at relevant sections to guide you.
## Writing your own AI
To use your own AI with this simulator, you can write your own AI which makes a move based on the given parameters as in [the sample AI function](ticTacToeCenterFirstAI.py) or even the necessary function in [the original game](ticTacToe.py). Then make necessary changes in [the simulator script](ticTacToeSimulator.py) to run it against the defined AI or against your very own AI.
